# Metro-DijkstraAlgo
This Project uses Dijkstra Algorithm to determine the shortest path from any Metro Station as source to all the possible Metro Stations.. The project is developed completely in java and has usecase in real time scenario. On selecting the source amongst any of metro stations it derives the shortest path to all the other metro stations.
